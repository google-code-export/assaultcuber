Google Code hosts our issue tracker, as well as a mirror (updated periodically) of our git repository.

Before Google Code stopped allowing more downloads, [a partial mirror of versions from 2.5.6 to 2.6](https://code.google.com/p/assaultcuber/downloads/list?can=1) is present here (see Codeplex or SourceForge for a complete mirror).
